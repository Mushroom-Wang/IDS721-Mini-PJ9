# Authentication
A simple Rust application that demonstrates how to implement basic authentication using Rust.

## Usage
```
cargo run
```
This will start the server on `http://localhost:8080`. To test the basic authentication, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/secure`.
## Configuration
By default, the application is configured to use the username "admin" and password "password" for basic authentication. You can change these values by modifying the `config.toml` file.
